# Dynamical-spin-correlations-at-infinite-temperature

This repository contains the quantum Monte Carlo simulation code that I wrote for our paper Marton Kanasz-Nagy, Izabella Lovas, Fabian Grusdt, Daniel Greif, Markus Greiner, and Eugene A. Demler, "Quantum correlations at infinite temperature: the dynamical Nagaoka effect", arXiv:1703.09231 (2017)

Please look at the paper for details. The code's workings are described in numerous comments.
