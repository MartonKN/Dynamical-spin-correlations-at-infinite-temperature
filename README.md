This repository contains the quantum Monte Carlo simulation code that I wrote for the paper 

Marton Kanasz-Nagy, Izabella Lovas, Fabian Grusdt, Daniel Greif, Markus Greiner, and Eugene A. Demler, "Quantum correlations at infinite temperature: the dynamical Nagaoka effect", arXiv:1703.09231 (2017)

We consider how adding a single quantum particle to a high (infinite) temperature spin environment can lead to spin correlations that are preserved during the time-scale of our simulations. In contrast to many high-temperature systems, the quantum correlations transfered by the particle to the environment are not washed out due to decoherence.

Please look into the paper for details. The code's workings are described in numerous comments.
